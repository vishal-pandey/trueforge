# Changelog

## 0.4.0-rc.1

### Minor Changes

- c6b78d9: Make sandbox provider port types identity-only; move Daytona lifecycle fields (`execTimeoutMs`, auto-stop/archive/delete intervals) onto host `DaytonaSandboxConfig`.

### Patch Changes

- c783700: Show schedule tasks, agent context, and failed run reasons in the schedules table.
- dd421b7: Add an action to restore the recent 30-day session list from a timestamp-pinned session.
- 73e146e: Make the compaction threshold an Auto/Custom selector: Auto omits `trigger` (runtime derives ~80% of the model context window); Custom reveals a number input defaulting to 50000.
- ff0cee5: Improve session timeline tooltips with sandbox tool details and grouped sub-agent tool calls.

## 0.4.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- a855122: Rename the published runtime package to `@truefoundry/trueforge-assistant-ui-runtime`, move it into the TrueForge workspace, rename its public runtime APIs to TrueForge, and remove the legacy TrueFoundry server adapter and server configuration.
- 829ac6e: Add OSS web-search provider settings and catalog (Parallel): singleton settings/catalog APIs, optional API key, and UI adapter without mode config so built-in web search works outside TrueFoundry mode.
- 829ac6e: Add web-search provider settings catalog port and Settings UI so admins can configure Parallel web search (API key + mode) in standalone/OIDC deployments.

### Patch Changes

- 0da3794: Stop the MCP OAuth opener from closing the popup as soon as the callback broadcasts, so the success/failure screen can show before the popup closes itself.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 56b3a59: Keep newly saved builders editable until the user leaves the build-agent page, then start fresh when they return.
- a122ba1: Show successful MCP authentication in chat, automatically continue after every required server connects, and indicate while the turn is starting. Confirm OAuth against the chat MCP connector read (`getMcpConnector`) so non-admins are not blocked by settings-only catalog GETs, and ignore authorize callbacks after the prompt unmounts.
- acad1a1: Add chat-history rename for servers that implement `renameSession`, including TrueForge harness title updates.
- a08c75a: Show absolute session activity timestamps on hover, label deferred MCP tools in the session timeline, and fix Safari collapsing contentSized modal bodies (flex-auto).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 51127c4: Gate `config.webSearch` on host capabilities: New Chat auto-enables with no toggle; New Agent / edit show a Runtime Config switch (default on when absent).
- d269b01: Add a live advanced agent configuration drawer with shared model, runtime, MCP tool, skill, and Save Agent editors.
- e74e953: Keep agent configuration visible on the left in full-width builder layouts, add a responsive instructions and initial-messages drawer with explicit save, make mobile config overlays closable, save the current instruction draft, align builder chrome, and preserve open widgets across chat runtime changes.
- a189482: Add routed agent detail pages with lazy Overview, Sessions, and Use In Code tabs backed by the optional AgentSessionsServer port and built-in TrueForge adapter.
- 8491843: Add a slot-driven agent Metrics tab with aggregate cards, time-range filtering, and Harness-backed line charts.
- e3973a5: Open agent model settings inline and support typed custom model parameters.
- a189482: Add the agent library Sessions tab and an all-user Sessions sidebar page (including drafts) with agent and time filters, shareable query params, and the same two-pane timeline. Library agent details keep the active tab in `?tab=` so opening an agent lands on Overview.
- 555bef0: Add a composer approval-nav banner (overridable `ApprovalNavBanner` slot) that counts pending tool approvals, pauses the composer, and jumps/expands/flashes the focused approval — including nested subagent tools.
- 3539da2: Add `brand.mode` (`icon-title` | `icon-only` | `logo`) so hosts pick chrome look first; `name` always labels the mark, and `resolveBrandChrome` maps mode to layout chrome.
- 16feb29: Add `customActionRenderers` so hosts can pause the composer on client-side tools with their own UI and resume via `onSubmit(content)`.
- 74eae6c: Remove pagination from list MCP servers across the API, SDK, and UI; return and search the complete configured MCP catalog client-side.
- bc11131: MCP selectors (composer + agent config) infinite-scroll through `listMcp` pages via DraftCatalogProvider.
- 0297727: Add context-management compaction triggers with model-aware defaults and migrate persisted legacy token thresholds.
- 860e322: Split New Chat vs New Agent: simple chat keeps the Connectors/Skills picker; New Agent keeps Agent Config + Save Agent. Session metadata `is_create_agent` drives resume from the sessions browser.
- 12b02ff: Open Runtime Config in a right-side drawer and label scheduled sessions consistently.
- 0cc59f8: Wire schedule test runs and show last five run status chips on the schedules table. Bump `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` to `0.1.25`.
- 0cc59f8: Add global Schedules page at `/schedules` with listing, popover-based filters, and create/edit drawer wired to the schedule API. New schedules save as paused, open a Test Schedule review with MCP connect status, and support Activate Anyway. List schedules uses server token pagination and multi-agent filters. Agents shows a Schedules count column (warning when any are paused) loaded via a batched list for on-screen agents. Add Table primitives with client-side and token pagination plus portal DropdownMenu so row actions are not clipped by overflow. Export a reusable popover select with single- and multi-select modes.
- 788636d: Sidebar layout is a permanent icon+label nav rail (no expand/collapse). Recent chats are hidden from the sidebar and mobile drawer; the drawer shows nav actions only.
- 04d2ee6: Add a `sidebarText` semantic token for sidebar nav labels, refresh trueforge sidebar colors, set trueforge base `radius` to `0.375rem` (6px), and set sidebar / thread-list control corners to `0.75rem` (12px).

  Expose design-system `Button` (`Button.Primary` / `.Secondary` / `.Ghost` / `.Destructive`). `ButtonVariant` is now `primary | secondary | ghost | destructive` (`default` renamed to `primary`; `outline` removed — use `secondary`). Button sizes are `large` (default) and `small` (`icon` for icon-only).

- 7e25f68: Open Save Agent in a right-side drawer with only the agent name while preserving configuration from Agent Config.
- 8f1a2dc: [truefoundry] Add a TrueFoundry-managed model registry. When `TRUEFOUNDRY_SERVICEFOUNDRY_SERVER_URL` is set, models are listed from the TrueFoundry ServiceFoundry server and turns are routed through the tenant's default AI Gateway with the caller's token. Mutually exclusive with OIDC. Supports internal mutual TLS to the ServiceFoundry server via `TRUEFOUNDRY_MTLS_ENABLED`/`TRUEFOUNDRY_MTLS_CERTS_DIR`.
- f8b5eeb: Add optional resource permissions and gate agent, schedule, and session mutations.

### Patch Changes

- 51127c4: Open Save Agent drawer on Clone with `{name}-clone` prefilled; stay on Agents list after save.
- d29717b: Clarify MCP API key entry: Bearer placeholders, auto-prefix Authorization values, and a header-name hint on the form.
- a273ed8: Preload Monaco when the UI shell mounts so tool request/response editors open faster.
- 347a7e7: Refresh composer and composer-trigger styling: 0.75rem composer corners with a light-theme primary-token gradient hairline (faded top → solid bottom) and a neutral hairline in dark, an icon-only tools trigger in place of the "Tools" caption and count badge, the shared `agent-2` glyph on the agents-library trigger, and squared-off chrome-action geometry on the save-agent trigger. Also fixes `agent-2.svg` to use `currentColor` so it is legible in dark mode.
- 2a0ae4c: Show connector catalog logos in the composer Tools picker, matching the Connectors settings page.
- 2a0ae4c: Align AttachmentCard with assistant-ui's default square thumbnail, filename tooltip, and overlay remove control.
- 762ecc0: [truefoundry] TrueFoundry skills catalog: proxy GET /skills and /skills/versions from ServiceFoundry; settings skill writes return 424. SkillManifest is a type-discriminated oneOf of GitSkill | TrueFoundryRegistrySkill (`type: truefoundry`; name is FQN, display_name is short). AvailableSkill exposes optional metadata (display_name, repository_name, version). AgentSpec skill refs allow opaque FQN names, optional preload (registry), and max 50. UI draft skill mounts map catalog `id` to AgentSpec `name`.
- a189482: Load agent Use In Code snippets through `client.internal.agents.getCodeSnippets` instead of a raw `client.fetch`.
- 26a9b80: Add an agent-scoped Schedules tab and route library schedule actions into it.
- 1b8a3f7: Add documentation links to the code snippets view and shell actions.
- 584e815: Gate Save Agent (create) on tenant CREATE from list-permissions, keep Update Agent on agent MANAGE, unwrap `{ type, permissions }`, and bump `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` to `0.1.39`.
- d2fdfc9: Add agent-filtered chat history labels, preserve Try Agent and explicit history-filter intent in URL query state while resolving backend IDs, reset active chats when users change filters, keep Try Agent highlighted as chat, and route fresh agent builders at `/build-agent` before their session URL is assigned.
- 8296c52: Make Runtime Config, MCP Servers, and Skills blocks clickable with a hover action icon, explain disabled sandbox and large-tool-response toggles in tooltips, and replace boxed capability cards with divider-separated columns.
- 8c31eae: Round-trip agent description through save/load and show it in the library and agent details.
- 0e01eba: Polish metric charts with sharp dot-free lines, distinct series colors, and a quieter Metrics tab background.
- c4ee138: Agent list and details overflow menu: Edit, Clone (`{name}-copy` via saveAgent), Manage Schedules, and Delete (wired through harness `deleteAgent`).
- 629b6e9: Paginate the Agent Sessions list on scroll instead of a "Load more" button, showing a skeleton row while the next page loads.
- c4ee138: AgentSessions list pane uses a quieter surface, and the resize grip stays gray until hover, press, or focus.
- 629b6e9: Fix Agents library table scrolling when rows exceed the viewport
- 26a9b80: Allow sending user messages that contain attachments without text.
- d7136a1: Avatar fallbacks use a light primary-button gradient in light mode, a solid primary gradient in dark mode, and show a single initial character.

- b11cfc3: Wire remote chat session deletion and improve the history delete action styling.
- fe6a14b: Improve session timelines with sub-agent wait states, grouped point-event markers, clean linear ticks, and readable summary durations.
- c4ee138: Agent Code (`SyntaxHighlighter` / `AgentCodeBlock`) copy control uses the bordered secondary button, and a trailing source newline no longer paints an empty last line while Copy still keeps the exact source.
- c0359ca: Strip a trailing slash from the `base_url` passed to agent code-snippets.
- 57f1fc2: Improve compact agent building with model configuration bottom sheets, provider-first model selection, and a contextual composer actions menu.

- 26a9b80: Require direct switch clicks in the Runtime Config sidebar.
- 531f0ce: Keep close-on-click dropdown menus and bottom sheets open when a click or drag lands on their own scrollbar, so scrolling a long menu no longer dismisses it before a choice is made.
- 1ec19f0: Replace API key replacement with connector configuration editing from the connector list and details view.
- c4ee138: Agents, Sessions, and Schedules empty states use a shared centered empty-box screen with title and supporting copy.
- b482cdd: Show the four primary agent metrics in a compact summary-card layout.
- b32d2be: Filter chat history to sessions created by the current user, and bump `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` to `0.1.34`.

- aa4be44: Open markdown links in assistant messages in a new tab
- 551b6a8: Default MCP tool approval to `@destructive` only. Selecting Other/read-only tools clears approval; selecting destructive tools keeps it on. Migrate mounts still carrying the old `@write`+`@destructive` default.
- 64ca089: Add a book-icon preload toggle and dashed add button to Agent Config MCP server pills.
- d269b01: Improve MCP and skill selectors with consistent search sizing, explicit MCP selection controls, grouped tool summaries, and removable MCP chips.
- 64ca089: Revamp the MCP tools selector modal with focus rows, connect empty state, and grouped selected-tools summary.
- 551b6a8: Let Build Agent pick which MCP tools require human approval, saved as `require_approval_for_tools` on the agent spec, and make unchecked tool checkboxes legible in both tool selectors.

- dc2151f: Paginate `GET /api/v1/agents` with `limit` / `page_token` and a `pagination` envelope; optional `agent_name` filters by case-insensitive substring. Agents library uses rows-per-page and prev/next against the token-paginated API. Schedule create and the schedules listing agent filter use a searchable agent combobox backed by the same filtered list API.
- 26a9b80: Show agent names without an icon in the Agents table.
- d7015fd: show mcp server tool name on tool approval
- d7136a1: Flip PopoverSelect menus when the preferred side lacks viewport room (e.g. table rows-per-page).

- 2284d3b: Polish the MCP tool selector controls, loading state, and API error messages.
- c4ee138: Resume Chat / Resume Agent building opens in a new tab when routed (`/sessions/:id` + square-arrow-out-up-right); without a router it keeps the in-shell resume fallback.
- 788636d: Open the create schedule drawer when Agents "+ Schedule" navigates with `isNew=true`, then clear the flag from the URL.
- e3973a5: Group schedule recurrence controls and display the cadence in an attached summary footer.
- d7136a1: Stop draining the full agents catalog on Schedules mount; load agents only when the filter opens (infinite scroll).
- f2ca338: Show active/paused schedule counts in the Agents library, pin selected MCPs when reopening the tools modal, and align paused schedule badge colors.
- ffbb239: Add a hover ellipsis delete menu with confirmation dialog on Sessions list rows.
- 333230d: Improve Agent Sessions with a resizable divider, accurate turn grouping, optional cost display, and reliable timeline tooltips with sub-agent details. Simplify schedule recurrence and default new schedules to the local timezone.
- d7136a1: Settings sidebar uses a subtle primary tint for the selected section instead of a solid fill.
- c4ee138: Unregister the `/settings` route when Settings chrome is unavailable (no catalog or `capabilities.settings.enabled` is false), matching the sidebar Settings button gate.
- ceeb56f: Show turn and duration statistics alongside the featured agent metric cards.
- 531f0ce: Cap the skill version menu height and scroll it, so skills with many versions no longer run off screen. While it is open, scrolling is confined to the menu.
- 77c5c33: [truefoundry] Show TrueFoundry skill repositories and versions in skill pickers, load version choices lazily, preserve the chosen version FQN when attaching skills, keep picker ordering stable while open, and add registry-only preload controls to selected skill pills.
- c4ee138: Split New Chat and New Agent draft preference stores. New Chat remembers only model (+ reasoning), skills, and MCP; New Agent keeps the full seed including runtime config.
- 4c1260e: [truefoundry] Wire TrueFoundry MCP authorize, status, and delete through ServiceFoundry; stub list auth_status; gate oauth2 invoke mid-turn with authRequired; paginate MCP server lists. UI treats SFY consent `code`/`error` on the FE landing like local DCR success/failure.
- 4e72afc: Use an animated thinking orb for application boot and server initialization.
- c4ee138: Per-turn Tokens in Agent Sessions shows a keyboard-accessible Input / Output / Cached tooltip (Input is uncached).
- a655537: Add a `turn.update` event schema with paused/running status and `action_required_on_events`.
- bc11131: Share a single `PageHeader` across chat and list chrome so title size/height stay consistent, and drop decorative title icons.
- 1b5b674: Add a host-overridable user avatar slot with initials and display-name chrome across every built-in layout, wired to the current authenticated frontend user.
- 26a9b80: Show weekly schedule days before the time controls.
- 1b8a3f7: Match the Build Agent configuration panel width to the agent playground and identify sessions created by schedule runs.
- adaf532: Widen the sidebar rail and its nav buttons so labels like "Build Agent" have more breathing room.
- 5d72138: Keep `npx @truefoundry/trueforge` working on native Windows: import Kysely migrations with `pathToFileURL`, and keep sandbox guest paths POSIX. Source development stays Unix/WSL; CI also runs unit and SQLite store tests on Windows.

## 0.3.0-rc.2

### Minor Changes

- 04d2ee6: Add a `sidebarText` semantic token for sidebar nav labels, refresh trueforge sidebar colors, set trueforge base `radius` to `0.375rem` (6px), and set sidebar / thread-list control corners to `0.75rem` (12px).

  Expose design-system `Button` (`Button.Primary` / `.Secondary` / `.Ghost` / `.Destructive`). `ButtonVariant` is now `primary | secondary | ghost | destructive` (`default` renamed to `primary`; `outline` removed — use `secondary`). Button sizes are `large` (default) and `small` (`icon` for icon-only).

### Patch Changes

- 2a0ae4c: Show connector catalog logos in the composer Tools picker, matching the Connectors settings page.
- 2a0ae4c: Align AttachmentCard with assistant-ui's default square thumbnail, filename tooltip, and overlay remove control.
- fe6a14b: Improve session timelines with sub-agent wait states, grouped point-event markers, clean linear ticks, and readable summary durations.
- d5b479d: Clamp optional sessions/schedules chrome and unregister `/sessions`, `/schedules`, and `/library/:agentId` when those server ports are omitted, matching the Settings Lego gate.
- 5d72138: Keep `npx @truefoundry/trueforge` working on native Windows: import Kysely migrations with `pathToFileURL`, and keep sandbox guest paths POSIX. Source development stays Unix/WSL; CI also runs unit and SQLite store tests on Windows.

## 0.3.0-rc.1

### Minor Changes

- d269b01: Add a live advanced agent configuration drawer with shared model, runtime, MCP tool, skill, and Save Agent editors.
- e74e953: Keep agent configuration visible on the left in full-width builder layouts, add a responsive instructions and initial-messages drawer with explicit save, make mobile config overlays closable, save the current instruction draft, align builder chrome, and preserve open widgets across chat runtime changes.
- a189482: Add routed agent detail pages with lazy Overview, Sessions, and Use In Code tabs backed by the optional AgentSessionsServer port and built-in TrueForge adapter.
- 8491843: Add a slot-driven agent Metrics tab with aggregate cards, time-range filtering, and Harness-backed line charts.
- a189482: Add the agent library Sessions tab and an all-user Sessions sidebar page (including drafts) with agent and time filters, shareable query params, and the same two-pane timeline. Library agent details keep the active tab in `?tab=` so opening an agent lands on Overview.
- bc11131: MCP selectors (composer + agent config) infinite-scroll through `listMcp` pages via DraftCatalogProvider.
- 860e322: Split New Chat vs New Agent: simple chat keeps the Connectors/Skills picker; New Agent keeps Agent Config + Save Agent. Session metadata `is_create_agent` drives resume from the sessions browser.
- 0cc59f8: Wire schedule test runs and show last five run status chips on the schedules table. Bump `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` to `0.1.25`.
- 0cc59f8: Add global Schedules page at `/schedules` with listing, popover-based filters, and create/edit drawer wired to the schedule API. New schedules save as paused, open a Test Schedule review with MCP connect status, and support Activate Anyway. List schedules uses server token pagination and multi-agent filters. Agents shows a Schedules count column (warning when any are paused) loaded via a batched list for on-screen agents. Add Table primitives with client-side and token pagination plus portal DropdownMenu so row actions are not clipped by overflow. Export a reusable popover select with single- and multi-select modes.
- 788636d: Sidebar layout is a permanent icon+label nav rail (no expand/collapse). Recent chats are hidden from the sidebar and mobile drawer; the drawer shows nav actions only.
- 8f1a2dc: [truefoundry] Add a TrueFoundry-managed model registry. When `TRUEFOUNDRY_SERVICEFOUNDRY_SERVER_URL` is set, models are listed from the TrueFoundry ServiceFoundry server and turns are routed through the tenant's default AI Gateway with the caller's token. Mutually exclusive with OIDC. Supports internal mutual TLS to the ServiceFoundry server via `TRUEFOUNDRY_MTLS_ENABLED`/`TRUEFOUNDRY_MTLS_CERTS_DIR`.

### Patch Changes

- 347a7e7: Refresh composer and composer-trigger styling: 0.75rem composer corners with a light-theme primary-token gradient hairline (faded top → solid bottom) and a neutral hairline in dark, an icon-only tools trigger in place of the "Tools" caption and count badge, the shared `agent-2` glyph on the agents-library trigger, and squared-off chrome-action geometry on the save-agent trigger. Also fixes `agent-2.svg` to use `currentColor` so it is legible in dark mode.
- a189482: Load agent Use In Code snippets through `client.internal.agents.getCodeSnippets` instead of a raw `client.fetch`.
- c4ee138: Agent list and details overflow menu: Edit, Clone (`{name}-copy` via saveAgent), Manage Schedules, and Delete (wired through harness `deleteAgent`).
- c4ee138: AgentSessions list pane uses a quieter surface, and the resize grip stays gray until hover, press, or focus.
- c4ee138: Agent Code (`SyntaxHighlighter` / `AgentCodeBlock`) copy control uses the bordered secondary button, and a trailing source newline no longer paints an empty last line while Copy still keeps the exact source.
- c4ee138: Agents, Sessions, and Schedules empty states use a shared centered empty-box screen with title and supporting copy.
- 0cc59f8: Use Google Sans as the default `trueforge` theme font and load it from Google Fonts when styles are injected.
- 64ca089: Hide Clear chat while the thread is fresh (New Chat, New Agent, and Try Agent) since there is nothing to clear.
- 64ca089: Add a book-icon preload toggle and dashed add button to Agent Config MCP server pills.
- d269b01: Improve MCP and skill selectors with consistent search sizing, explicit MCP selection controls, grouped tool summaries, and removable MCP chips.
- 64ca089: Revamp the MCP tools selector modal with focus rows, connect empty state, and grouped selected-tools summary.
- bc11131: New Chat enables sandbox on the live draft agent config when capabilities report sandbox as available.
- c4ee138: Resume Chat / Resume Agent building opens in a new tab when routed (`/sessions/:id` + square-arrow-out-up-right); without a router it keeps the in-shell resume fallback.
- 788636d: Open the create schedule drawer when Agents "+ Schedule" navigates with `isNew=true`, then clear the flag from the URL.
- 333230d: Improve Agent Sessions with a resizable divider, accurate turn grouping, optional cost display, and reliable timeline tooltips with sub-agent details. Simplify schedule recurrence and default new schedules to the local timezone.
- c4ee138: Unregister the `/settings` route when Settings chrome is unavailable (no catalog or `capabilities.settings.enabled` is false), matching the sidebar Settings button gate.
- c4ee138: Split New Chat and New Agent draft preference stores. New Chat remembers only model (+ reasoning), skills, and MCP; New Agent keeps the full seed including runtime config.
- 4c1260e: [truefoundry] Wire TrueFoundry MCP authorize, status, and delete through ServiceFoundry; stub list auth_status; gate oauth2 invoke mid-turn with authRequired; paginate MCP server lists. UI treats SFY consent `code`/`error` on the FE landing like local DCR success/failure.
- c4ee138: Per-turn Tokens in Agent Sessions shows a keyboard-accessible Input / Output / Cached tooltip (Input is uncached).
- bc11131: Share a single `PageHeader` across chat and list chrome so title size/height stay consistent, and drop decorative title icons.

## 0.3.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- 3539da2: Add `brand.mode` (`icon-title` | `icon-only` | `logo`) so hosts pick chrome look first; `name` always labels the mark, and `resolveBrandChrome` maps mode to layout chrome.
- 16feb29: Add `customActionRenderers` so hosts can pause the composer on client-side tools with their own UI and resume via `onSubmit(content)`.
- 0297727: Add context-management compaction triggers with model-aware defaults and migrate persisted legacy token thresholds.

### Patch Changes

- b11cfc3: Wire remote chat session deletion and improve the history delete action styling.
- 3ca4e2e: fixed the button component icon and padding, delete conflicting local prettier.json in trueforge-ui package
- a655537: Update published dependency ranges (AI SDK, Hono, MCP SDK, Redis, assistant-ui, and related packages).
- aa4be44: Open markdown links in assistant messages in a new tab
- d7015fd: show mcp server tool name on tool approval
- Updated dependencies [648273b]
  - @truefoundry/trueforge-sdk@0.1.4-rc.0

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- **`brand.mode`** — explicit chrome look. Set `mode`, then pass the fields it requires.
  `name` always labels the mark (`alt` / `aria-label`):
  - **`'icon-title'`** — `name` + optional `icon` (title shown in expanded chrome)
  - **`'icon-only'`** — `name` + `icon` (alt kept, no title text)
  - **`'logo'`** — `name` + `icon` + `logo` (wordmark in expanded chrome; `name` is alt only)
  - **Default** — omit `brand` for the TrueForge wordmark / square mark
- **`resolveBrandChrome()`** — maps `brand.mode` to
  `{ expandedVariant, collapsedVariant, showTitle }`. `SidebarLayout` uses it; custom
  layouts should too.

### Changed

- **`BrandConfig`** — discriminated on `mode` (`BrandMode`). Removed `showTitle` from
  config; visible title follows the mode.

## 0.2.4

- abd9e38: Agents Library rows: show connectors before skills, use the composer's lightbulb icon for skills, and reveal the connector/skill names in a tooltip on hover.
- cc49d4a: Rename catalog, sandbox-file download, and MCP tools paths; Fern upsert becomes create_or_update. Sessions and turns default and max 25; session and turn event lists default and max 100.
- d7a640f: Align OpenAPI type names across AgentSpec, settings, catalogs, and chat pickers: Catalog/Configured/Available resource views, AgentSpec nested Model/Skill/InitialUserMessage, Put*Request → Update*Request, MCP acronym casing, GetMeResponse, and explicit names for nested AgentSpec/capabilities schemas.
- 7e2e02c: Refresh composer catalogs whenever settings close, including navigating to a chat or named agent.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c5223ad: Ship `react-dom` and `react-router-dom` as package dependencies instead of peers so consumers no longer need to install them separately.
- 92ee970: Decode common escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\uXXXX`, …) in user-facing API error messages and render them with `whitespace-pre-wrap` so multi-line Zod validation output displays correctly.
- 53104b1: Keep active and remembered draft sandbox settings synchronized with server capabilities.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a4d1a7: Add opt-in `withRouter` URL sync for shell places (`/`, `/agents/:agentName`, `/sessions/:sessionId`, `/settings`), with path customization via `routes` and `react-router-dom` as an optional peer. Serve the app shell for client-side deep links from the TrueForge server.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f08a99: Remember plain-draft composer choices (model, skills, MCP connectors, config) across New Chat and reloads via localStorage. Edit-flow and immutable library agents are unchanged. `TrueForgeUI` `layout` is optional and defaults to `"sidebar"`.
- b56c003: Initial 0.1.0-rc.1 prerelease of all public packages.

### Patch Changes

- e9bf976: Wrap settings MCP, skills, model-provider, and sandbox create/put bodies as `{ manifest }`. List/get items nest the stored document (`name` plus `manifest`, plus derived fields). Create returns 201. Chat lists and catalogs stay flat. Adapter catalogs follow the new SDK shapes.
- a9e8187: Improve nested tool approval handling and bump `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime`.
- 0730213: Save Agent dialog: add a per-connector **preload** toggle (writes `mcp_servers[].preload`), render the capabilities as side-by-side cards, and declutter the modal — inline model/connector/skill chips (model shows its provider logo), the "Connectors" label, no subtitle, content-sized height, and tighter spacing. Tooltips now portal into the nearest `<dialog>` so they render above modal content.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` ≥ 0.1.18** — depends on the consolidated
  runtime release that includes:
  - `getModels` → `properties.reasoningEfforts` for thinking-capable models
  - extras ancestor walk so nested/readonly AUI clients resolve
    `useTrueFoundryRespondToToolApproval` (sub-agent Allow/Deny)
  - parallel enabled-models + provider-metadata CP fetches
  - `ModelSelectorEntry.name` / `id` = `model_fqn` (`account/model-id`)
  - gateway mount sanitization (`normalizeMcpMount` / `normalizeSkillMount`,
    registry `enableTools` default `["@all"]`)

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent Allow/Deny** — nested tool approvals inside `create_sub_agent` now
  call `useTrueFoundryRespondToToolApproval` with the _nested_ tool's approval
  id. The old bridge keyed off the outer sub-agent part (usually with no
  approval), so clicks silently no-op'd. Requires `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime`
  ≥ 0.1.19 so extras resolve through the readonly nested AUI client.
- **Sandbox provider contract** — drop `snapshotName` from `SandboxProviderConfig`
  and wrap `listSandboxProviders` as `{ data, snapshotSyncStatus }` (Harness
  `status` / `status_reason`). Re-exports `SandboxProviderListEntry` /
  `SandboxSnapshotSyncStatus`.

### Added

- **Draft composer preferences** — plain-draft model, skills, MCP connectors, and
  config choices are remembered (in-memory + `localStorage`) and seed the next
  New Chat after reload. Stale catalog entries are pruned once catalogs load.
  Edit-flow (`agentId` set) and immutable library agents are unchanged.
- **Optional `layout`** — `<TrueForgeUI />` `layout` prop defaults to `"sidebar"`.
- **`type: "trueforge"` built-in server** — `<TrueForgeUI server={{ type: 'trueforge', baseUrl?, token?, fetch? }} />`
  resolves a full Harness `AgentUIServer` via
  `@truefoundry/trueforge-ui/plugins/trueforge-agent-server-adapter`
  (`createTrueForgeAgentUIServer`), including chat, builder, and default settings
  catalogs. Depends on `@truefoundry/trueforge-sdk` (workspace:* in-monorepo; external in the bundle).
- **Light/dark brand logo** — `theme.brand.logo` accepts a `BrandLogoConfig`
  (`{ src?, light?, dark?, href? }`). The source is picked from the resolved theme
  mode, falling back to the other mode and then `src`, so a single configured mode
  covers both and `{ light }` alone never renders a missing image. `href` wraps the
  logo in a same-tab link. A bare string (`logo: '/logo.svg'`) is shorthand for a
  mode-agnostic source. A config with no usable source falls back to the default
  mark rather than an empty `<img>`.
- **`BrandLogo` slot** — now in the slot table and resolved through `useSlot` by
  every layout, so `overrides={{ BrandLogo: MyMark }}` reaches the sidebar header,
  widget FAB, and welcome screen.
- **`useBrandName()`** — the configured brand name or the default, so layouts no
  longer inline the fallback string.

### Changed

- **Theme preset rename** — default preset id `truefoundry` → `trueforge`
  (`ThemePreset`, `PRESETS`, `data-preset`, docs).
- **Styles auto-inject** — `ThemeProvider` injects the SDK stylesheet at runtime.
  Hosts no longer need `@import '@truefoundry/trueforge-ui/styles.css'` (export
  kept for SSR). Semantic tokens and dark mode are scoped to `.aui-theme-root`
  (no `html.dark` / `:root` retheme of the host page).
- **Dependency** — `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` pinned to `0.1.13`.
  `ModelSelectorEntry` now requires `id`, nested `provider: ProviderEntry`, and
  `properties: ModelProperties` (replacing flat `provider` / `providerLogo` /
  `reasoningEfforts`). Re-exports `ProviderEntry` and `ModelProperties`.

### Fixed

- **History row mutability** — prefer `custom.isMutable` from the session (runtime
  stamp) over inferring from `agentName`. Orphaned named refs (deleted agent, no
  `agentName`) open as immutable. `openHistorySession` allows `isMutable: false`
  without an agent name.
- **Edit-bound draft history switch** — do not reuse the mutable shell via
  `switchToThread` when the shell still carries an Edit `agentName`/`agentId`
  and the row is a different session. Remount through `openHistorySession` so
  Update Agent chrome cannot overwrite the wrong library agent.

### Breaking

- **Server-port types owned by `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime`** — this package no
  longer defines `AgentChatServer` / `AgentBuilderServer` / catalog DTOs locally.
  Host-facing types are re-exported from `@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime/server`
  via `src/server/types.ts`. Prefer importing types from `@truefoundry/trueforge-ui`
  (hosts should not need the runtime package for types). Requires runtime `0.1.13`.
- **Removed public pagination helpers** — `PageResult`, `TokenPagination`,
  `ListSessionsResponse`, `ListTurnsResponse`, `ListSessionEventsResponse`, and
  opaque `SessionEvent` are gone from this package. Chat list APIs use runtime
  `ListResult<T>` (`{ data, nextPageToken? }`).
- **`AgentUIServer` / mounts follow the runtime contract** — composed port matches
  runtime `AgentUIServerPort`; `SkillMount` / `McpServerMount` stay opaque `object`
  (hosts widen via generics). Implement `getCapabilities()` on every builder host.
- **One brand component** — removed the `BrandIcon` export; `BrandLogo` is the only
  product mark and renders the mark alone. Callers that also want the name as text
  pair it with `useBrandName()` (as the sidebar header does), rather than relying on
  a second component that hard-codes one arrangement. Replace `<BrandIcon />` with
  `<BrandLogo />`, and `overrides={{ BrandIcon }}` with `overrides={{ BrandLogo }}`.
- **`brand.name` is required** — `theme.brand` stays optional, but setting it now
  requires `name`, since it labels the logo and a logo with no name has no accessible
  name. `logo` remains optional, so `brand: { name: 'Acme' }` still pairs host text
  with the default mark. `useBrand()` returns `Partial<BrandConfig>`, since `brand`
  may be absent entirely.
- **`theme.brand` is images-only** — removed `brand.icon`; there is one logo source.
  Removed the `ReactNode` and render-function variants of the logo value (and with
  them the `BrandImage` type export), so `brand.logo` is now
  `string | BrandLogoConfig`. Component-valued marks move to the slot table:
  `overrides={{ BrandLogo: MyMark }}`, which is how every other atom is replaced.
  Also removed `alt` — the logo is labelled with `brand.name`, so there is one place
  to set the accessible name.
- **Default brand name is `"TrueForge"`** (was `"TrueFoundry"`), used by
  `BrandLogo`, the sidebar header, and `useBrandName()`.
- **`ShellMode` shape** — replaced `type: 'idle' | 'named' | 'draft'` with
  `status: 'idle' | 'active'` plus `isMutable` on active bindings. Composer /
  Save Agent / welcome chrome key off `isMutable`, not draft|named.
  Hosts that inspected `mode.type` must switch to `mode.status` /
  `mode.isMutable` (see `shellIsMutable`).
- **Renamed `TrueFoundryAssistantUI` → `TrueForgeUI`** (props type
  `TrueFoundryAssistantUIProps` → `TrueForgeUIProps`). Update imports and JSX.
- **`TrueForgeUI` agent props** — replaced top-level `agentName` and
  `defaultAgentSpec` with a single discriminated `agentConfig`. There is no
  compat shim; hosts must update call sites.
- **Icons use Lucide** (`lucide-react`) instead of Font Awesome. Default
  registry keys are unchanged (`paperclip`, `xmark`, …); `theme.icons` values
  are Lucide components, React nodes, render fns, or SVGR SVGs — not
  `IconDefinition`. Drop `@fortawesome/*` if you only used them for this SDK.
- **Removed `tfy-web-components`** dependency and peer. Primitives, icons,
  theme, Markdown, and agent-chat molecules are owned by this SDK.
- `theme` prop is now `ThemeConfig` (object), not `"light" | "dark"`. Mode
  lives at `theme.mode`. Example: `theme={{ mode: "dark", preset: "claude" }}`.
- `AtomSlots` and `SlotOverrides` are derived from `defaultSlots`; consumer
  module augmentation of `AtomSlots` no longer adds override keys.
- `theme.classNames.openui` accepts only `root` and `scope`; arbitrary extra
  keys are no longer supported.
- Complete `SemanticTokens` objects must include `success`,
  `successForeground`, `warning`, and `warningForeground`.
- `Button`, `IconButton`, dialogs, sheets, avatars, and other low-level
  primitives are customized through tokens/CSS rather than slots. Compound
  APIs (`Button.Primary`, `icon=` string props) are gone.
- Import styles with only `@import "@truefoundry/trueforge-ui/styles.css"`
  (no `tfy-web-components/theme.css`).
- `layout` accepts a built-in string **or** a host `React.ComponentType`.
- **`server` prop no longer accepts `{ type: "custom", server }`.** Pass a ready
  `AgentUIServer` directly (`server={agentServer}`). Built-in configs
  (`truefoundry` / `trueforge`) are unchanged and now accept an optional
  `catalog`.

### Added

- **Named agent header title** — when an immutable (named) agent chat is open,
  the thread header shows the agent name on the left (sidebar / drawer / dock /
  widget layouts). Hidden for idle and draft/mutable chats.
- **`AgentLibraryEntry.agentId?` / `agentSpec?`** — optional listing fields.
  Hosts that only return `{ name }` keep working; `agentSpec` enables Edit.
- **Agents Library Edit** — when `isComposerEnabled` and the row has
  `agentSpec`, Edit binds a mutable session seeded from that spec
  (`isMutable: true`). Try Agent remains immutable (`isMutable: false`).
- **`selectLibraryAgent` / `shellIsMutable` / `libraryAgentId`** on shell
  context. `selectAgent` / `openDraft` remain as thin wrappers.
- **Reasoning-effort selector** beside the model picker in the draft composer.
  Shown only when the selected `ModelSelection` declares `reasoningEfforts`;
  the effort is coerced into the spec on model change or explicit pick.
- **Skills catalog** — `getSkillCatalog` with an Available/Selected split;
  registry skills (`catalogId`) return to Available on remove, GitHub imports
  are deleted for good. New types: `RegistrySkill`, `GithubSkill`,
  `DefinedSkill`, `SkillConfigBase`, `SkillCatalogEntry`,
  `CreateSkillRequestBase`, `SelectRegistrySkillRequest`,
  `ImportGithubSkillRequest`, `SkillCatalogServer.getSkillCatalog`.
- **Sandbox catalog** — list/create/update/delete of connected sandboxes from a
  catalog. New types: `SandboxConfig`, `SandboxCatalogEntry`, `SandboxBase`,
  `CreateSandboxRequest`, `UpdateSandboxRequest`, `SandboxCatalogServer`.
  `apiKey` is never stored in the catalog and is optional on update (blank keeps
  the existing key).
- `TrueForgeBuiltInServerConfig` exported for hosts that build the built-in
  config separately.

- **`agentConfig` shell modes** on `TrueForgeUI` /
  `ShellModeProvider`:
  - `SingleAgent` — locked named agent (`name` required)
  - `AgentLibrary` — Agents Library only; idle empty state until pick; no New Chat
  - `AgentComposer` — draft composer only (no library)
  - `AgentLibraryWithComposer` — library + draft (default when omitted)
- **Clear Chat** control in thread headers (sidebar / drawer / dock / widget).
  Resets the current named thread or opens a fresh draft.
- `ClearChatButton`, `SelectAgentEmptyState`, `AgentConfig`,
  `DEFAULT_AGENT_CONFIG` exported from the main barrel.
- Owned `ThemeProvider` with light / dark / system, CSS token injection,
  `theme.brand`, `theme.icons`, `theme.classNames`, `theme.className`.
- Semantic success/warning and assistant-bubble tokens, plus complete Markdown,
  syntax-highlighter, OpenUI, and Monaco class-name hooks.
- Presets: `truefoundry`, `claude`, `chatgpt`, `gemini`.
- `BrandLogo` / `BrandIcon` / `useBrand`; `Icon` / `IconRegistry`.
- Registry-backed robot brand fallback and overridable welcome/OAuth state
  icons. The standalone OAuth callback now inherits the shell theme and slots.
- In-repo Markdown (OpenUI fences + syntax-highlighter), `MonacoEditorCore`,
  `CodeEditor`.
- Public slots for agent-library/save/select controls, draft composer
  selectors, code/content renderers, and file-download UI; nested SDK
  composition now honors those overrides.
- Example app: preset switcher + custom layout demo; `VITE_TFY_AGENT_MODE` to
  try shell modes.

### Migration

#### Component rename

```tsx
// Before
import { TrueFoundryAssistantUI } from '@truefoundry/trueforge-ui';
<TrueFoundryAssistantUI server={server} layout="sidebar" />;

// After
import { TrueForgeUI } from '@truefoundry/trueforge-ui';
<TrueForgeUI server={server} layout="sidebar" />;
```

#### `agentConfig` (host must update)

| Before                                           | After                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentName="support-agent"`                      | `agentConfig={{ mode: "SingleAgent", name: "support-agent" }}`                                |
| omit `agentName` (+ optional `defaultAgentSpec`) | omit `agentConfig`, or `agentConfig={{ mode: "AgentLibraryWithComposer", defaultAgentSpec }}` |
| —                                                | `agentConfig={{ mode: "AgentLibrary" }}` — library only, pick agent to start                  |
| —                                                | `agentConfig={{ mode: "AgentComposer", defaultAgentSpec }}` — draft only                      |

```tsx
// Before
<TrueFoundryAssistantUI server={server} layout="sidebar" agentName="support-agent" />
<TrueFoundryAssistantUI
  server={server}
  layout="sidebar"
  defaultAgentSpec={{ model: { name: "openai-main/gpt-4.1" } }}
/>

// After
<TrueForgeUI
  server={server}
  layout="sidebar"
  agentConfig={{ mode: "SingleAgent", name: "support-agent" }}
/>
<TrueForgeUI
  server={server}
  layout="sidebar"
  agentConfig={{
    mode: "AgentLibraryWithComposer",
    defaultAgentSpec: { model: { name: "openai-main/gpt-4.1" } },
  }}
/>
```

`ShellModeProvider` likewise takes `agentConfig` instead of `agentName` /
`defaultAgentSpec`.

#### Other Unreleased migrations

1. Drop `@import "tfy-web-components/theme.css"` and the `tfy-web-components`
   package.
2. Replace `theme="dark"` with `theme={{ mode: "dark" }}`.
3. Update Button/IconButton overrides to the new prop surface.
4. Replace product marks via `theme.brand`; action icons via `theme.icons`
   (Lucide / SVG — not Font Awesome `IconDefinition`).
5. Optionally set `layout={MyLayout}` and style content via
   `theme.classNames` or `.aui-markdown` / `.aui-syntax-highlighter` /
   `.aui-openui` / `.aui-monaco`.
6. Remove consumer `AtomSlots` module augmentations and use the documented
   `SlotOverrides` keys.
7. Replace custom `theme.classNames.openui` keys with `root`, `scope`, or host
   CSS targeting `.aui-openui`.
8. Add success/warning pairs to any complete custom `SemanticTokens` maps.

## [0.1.0]

### Breaking

- Main entry no longer re-exports tfy design-system **values** (`Button`,
  `IconButton`, `IconProvider`, `Modal`, `Dialog`, `Accordion*`, `Skeleton`,
  `LightTooltip`, `registerIcons`, …). Import those from `tfy-web-components`.
  Override **types** `ButtonProps` / `ButtonSize` / `IconButtonProps` remain
  on `@truefoundry/trueforge-ui`.
- Peer dependency ranges aligned with supported versions (`@truefoundry/assistant-ui-runtime` `^0.1.4`, `truefoundry-gateway-sdk` `^0.4.0-rc.1`, `tfy-web-components` `^0.0.31`).
- tfy/MUI peer stack (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/*`, Font Awesome, `@openuidev/*`) moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`; hosts must install them.
- `MessageTimestamp` is presentational and requires `createdAt`.
- `UserMessageActionBar` is presentational (copy/edit/retry props); runtime wiring lives in containers.
- `MessageActionBar` accepts optional `createdAt` and passes it to `MessageTimestamp`.
- Default stylesheet no longer loads Google Fonts from the CDN; override `--font-agent-ui` in host CSS if needed.
- `prepare` script replaced with `prepublishOnly` (install no longer builds automatically).

### Added

- `TrueForgeUI` quick-start component with `layout`: `sidebar` | `drawer` |
  `dock` | `widget` (slots outside the chat provider so toast overrides apply).
- Curated re-exports: `useAui`, `useAuiState`, `AssistantState` from the main
  barrel and `@truefoundry/trueforge-ui/assistant-ui`; `useTheme` from the main
  barrel.
- Optional `onThreadOpen` on `ThreadListContainer` for stack/drawer chrome.
- npm package metadata: `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `keywords`.
- Drawer / widget Escape-to-close; drawer backdrop dismiss; widget `aria-modal`.
- Drawer / widget focus management (`inert` on background, focus dialog, restore).
- `docs/api.md` curated public API reference.
- CI coverage floor + example app build.
- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- GitHub issue/PR templates and CI workflow.
- `docs/` (architecture, customization, compatibility).
- ESLint + Prettier.
- Unit tests for tool-call parsing helpers and `computeAgentStepsSplit`.

### Changed

- Required peers are only `react` / `react-dom`. `@assistant-ui/core`
  (`^0.2.22`), `@assistant-ui/react` (`^0.14.24`), and
  `tfy-web-components@^0.0.32` moved to `dependencies` (still listed as optional
  peers for hosts that install them directly for customization). Happy path:
  `yarn add @truefoundry/trueforge-ui`. Yarn `resolutions` pin a single
  `@assistant-ui/core` / `store` / `tap` copy to avoid duplicate AuiProvider.
- `tfy-web-components` resolves from npm (`^0.0.32`) instead of a local
  `file:` tarball.
- MUI / Emotion / OpenUI / Monaco / extra Font Awesome packages come from
  `tfy-web-components` (not peers of this SDK).
- Font Awesome packages this SDK imports (`fontawesome-svg-core`,
  `free-solid-svg-icons`) moved to `dependencies`.
- `SlotOverrides` is `Partial<AtomSlots>` only (no `Record<string, unknown>`).
- `TrueForgeUI` lazy-layout `Suspense` fallback is a pulse skeleton
  instead of blank.
- README reordered: quick start (prefer `client`) before advanced sections.

### Removed

- Unused `TokensProvider` / `useTokens` / `defaultTokens` public API (and
  related token types). Theme via CSS variables from `styles.css` instead.
- `examples/vite-chat` sample app.
- Unused `classnames` dependency (provided by `tfy-web-components@^0.0.32`).
- Direct design-system `devDependencies` duplicated from web-components
  (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/*`, `@openuidev/*`, `monaco-editor`,
  `@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`).
- Standalone `@truefoundry/trueforge-ui/openui.css` export — OpenUI styles ship
  inside `styles.css`.
- Unused packages: `lodash-es`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `class-variance-authority`.
- Broken `pack:dev` script.

### Fixed

- Error toasts stack (up to 5), use compact theme sizing, and include a copy action.
- Atom/container architecture: atoms no longer import `@assistant-ui/*`.
- Error toasts truncate large gateway response bodies.

### Note

- `github-markdown-css` remains a **devDependency** required to compile
  `dist/styles.css` (pulled in via tfy Markdown CSS).

## [0.0.8] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Package and dependency updates prior to the 0.1.0 open-source readiness pass.
